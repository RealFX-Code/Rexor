this is dead, go away...

Rexor is a free / open source game launcher, made to look like an actual game launcher.

When play button is pressed, it opens .\\bin\rexor-32.exe
Unless, Debug mode is enabled, in wich case it opens .\\bin\rexor-debug-32.exe

Source code can be found and edited in this repository,
this was the first C# project i have done, so it's going
to have some bad code.

Thanks, RealFX.
